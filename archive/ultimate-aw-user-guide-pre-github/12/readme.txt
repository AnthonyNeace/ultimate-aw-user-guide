INSTALLATION
-----
Upon unzipping these files, the DEFAULT.AWH file should be moved to

 C:/ > Active Worlds > Help

and replace the existing default.awh file.  You may rename the existing file 'defaultbackup' if you want to preserve it.




USAGE
-----
The Ultimate AW User Guide makes use of the 'User Guide' tab that can be found in the tabs menu by pressing F9 while in the Active Worlds Browser.

The User Guide provides a myriad of information and teleports, under the following categories.

- AW <VERSION NUMBER> (<BUILD NUMBER>)
- Staying Connected in the Active Worlds Universe
- SW City Network
- The Ultimate Guide to Bots and the SDK
- The ultimate Guide to Building
- The Ultimate Guide to Activities and Gaming
- The Ultimate guide to Owning a World
- Ultimate Teleports List
- Active Worlds Official User Guide

The guide as a whole may seemed biased towards SW City... and that's because it is.  This project evolved out of the 'Ultimate Teleports List' that has been developed in SW City over the past several years.  I took hold of the project and updated it several years ago for SW City and New Arklay City teleports.  These have now expanded to a more general universe settting -- though the original emphasis on the SW City Network is still very much present.

BUGS
-----
If your copy of the Ultimate AW User Guide is not working properly, there are a few known bugs I encounter each time I upgrade the guide.  If you encounter a problem, below are some methods to go about fixing them:

	1. Topics are archived in the wrong place

	Topics are organized by a method in the .awh file where the information they are dependant upon is closed within two tags.  These two tags are called topic and endtopic.  If a topic is acting funky, it may be missing an entopic.  Simply search the default.awh file for that topic and try adding an endtopic to the end of the document.  If that doesn't work, you may have to do it closer to the problem topic.  You can search documents quickly with the shortcut Control+F.

	2. User Guide Tab is blank upon loading AW

	If this happens then I've incorrectly encoded the document before I uploaded it.  If you have Windows Vista or 7, you can fix this by opening default.awh in the Help folder in your Active Worlds folder, and saving it again.  An encoding option comes up at the save screen.

	If you have XP or below, you may have to download a special text editor to do this -- I recommend Notepad++. It's a handy editor commonly used by programmers, and should have an option for encoding on the top menu.

	Anyway, in Vista the encoding on my system is set to ANSI by default.  Close AW, change this to 'Unicode', save the file, and try popping back in.
